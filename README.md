Alternative icon sets for popular applications.

## What is this?

This is just a collection of icons I decided to create since the options out there I didn't really like.

## What have I made so far?

- A set of icons similar to the Adobe programs for popular linux applications. This includes Gimp, Inkscape, InVision, Kdenlive and a few others.
